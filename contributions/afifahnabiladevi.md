## 14. Additional Comments

I would like to express my high appreciation to all team members for their collaboration and support. Although I did not have the opportunity to contribute directly to the technical analysis, my role in **designing the presentation and coordinating** has been an interesting and challenging experience. The process of translating complex forensic data into concise and digestible visuals, including the compilation of reports I had not attempted before, provided significant new skill development. This experience enriched my understanding of how technical output is transformed into strategic communication.
